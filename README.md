# Railway-Reservation-System

The provided Python code establishes a system for managing a railway system using SQLite for database operations. Here is a description based on the functionality of the code:

The code begins with importing necessary libraries like Streamlit for web app creation, SQLite3 for database operations, and Pandas for data manipulation. It then connects to a SQLite database named 'railway_system.db' and sets the initial page to 'Login or Sign Up'. The code defines functions to create different tables in the database to store user information, employee details, and train information. These functions ensure that the required tables exist in the database or create them if they don't already exist.

One of the functions, add_train, adds a new train entry to the 'trains' table with specific details like train number, name, departure date, and destinations. It also creates a corresponding seat table for the new train to manage seat bookings. Another function, delete_train, allows for the deletion of a train entry based on the train number and departure date, along with relevant notifications to the user interface.

The code includes functions for booking and canceling tickets (book_ticket and cancel_tickets), which interact with the seat tables to assign and release seats for passengers. Additionally, there are functions to search for trains based on train numbers or starting and ending destinations, providing search results to users.

Furthermore, the code implements functionality to view all available trains (view_trains) and display detailed seat information for a specific train (view_seats). The web application interface is created using Streamlit, allowing users to perform actions like adding trains, booking tickets, canceling tickets, and managing train details through a user-friendly interface.

Overall, the Python code creates a comprehensive railway system management system with database integration, seat allocation, ticket booking, and search functionalities to handle various aspects of managing a railway system effectively.
